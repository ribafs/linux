In light of the unreadability and overcomplication of answers, i believe this is what the requestor should do

    add that script to the PATH
    run the script as . scriptname

The . (dot) will make sure the script is not run in a child shell.

Exemplo
laravel new $1
cd $1
composer require laravel/jetstream
php artisan jetstream:install livewire
npm install && npm run dev
echo
echo
echo
echo "=================================="
php artisan -V
echo "Instalado com autenticação usando jetstream e livewire"
