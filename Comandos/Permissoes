chown -R ribafs:ribafs /backup;
find /backup -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find /backup -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;



Edit /home/<your_user>/.bashrc (or /root/.bashrc) and write the following line:

umask 0022 

This is the default umask. The sticky bit is disabled and you've got 644 for files and 755 for directories by default.

Altair4, thanks, your solution worked.
Here are the steps I followed:
In terminal, run gksu gedit
Enter text umask 0007
Save as /etc/profile.d/umask.sh
reboot
