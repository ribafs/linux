1) Create a folder on your host machine

2) Start VirtualBox and open the settings for your Mint system.

Add a "Machine Folder" and select the folder you want to share

Check the "Make Permanent" box so you don't have to repeat these steps.

You can then check "Auto-mount"

4) Start your virtual OS.

If you checked "Auto-mount" in step 2) the share folder will actually be mounted in /mdeia. 
The problem is that your user isn't a member of the vboxsf group (meanig you can't open it). We can fix this by adding our-self to the group:

Abra o terminal da VM
sudo gpasswd -a mintweb vboxsf
sudo reboot


You should now be able to navigate to the folder:

Code: Select all   Expand view
        cd /media/sf_<ShareName>/
